# Traits

Traits are implemented as value generators that can be configured to produce values based on well understood probability
distributions, which allows the designer to predict and stochastically model gameplay events without having to always
playtest and measure the variance and character of certain desired outcomes. Beyond this traits are supposed to just be
a stack of annotated values that can be compared in all kinds of situations.

The initial use case for traits is to enable the most basic relationship between price decisions by a player to affect
the actual type of visitors that arrive at the garage.
